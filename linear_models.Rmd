logstic regression for the binary variables.



## Let's get started.

We gonna use airbnb. 1st: Data cleaning.
```{r}
data("nyc_airbnb")

nyc_airbnb = 
  nyc_airbnb %>% 
  mutate(stars = review_scores_location / 2) %>% 
  rename(
    boro = neighbourhood_group,
    neighborhood = neighbourhood) %>% 
  filter(boro != "Staten Island") %>% 
  select(price, stars, boro, neighborhood, room_type)
```

Fit a first linear model!

boro is the category.
```{r}
fit = lm(price ~ stars + boro, data = nyc_airbnb)

summary(fit)
coef(fit)
summary(fit)$coef
```

tidy the results instead.
```{r}
fit %>% 
  broom::tidy() %>% 
  mutate(term = str_replace(term, "boro", "Boro:")) %>% 
  knitr::kable(digits = 3)

fit %>% 
  broom::glance()
```

##Take a look at factors. (Factor predictors)

#Does this have any meaning??
```{r}
nyc_airbnb = 
  nyc_airbnb %>% 
  mutate(
    boro = fct_infreq(boro),  # put the boro in order according to their frequency.
    room_type = fct_infreq(room_type)  
  )
```

refit the last model
```{r}
fit = lm(price ~ stars + boro, data = nyc_airbnb) %>% 
  broom::tidy()
#p value here is saying whether the coef is significant.
```
